Java-Getopt JAR was downloaded from http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/hacking/download.html.
Note that it is licensed under the GNU Library General Public License which is slightly
different (older) than GNU Lesser General Public License that Babel uses.
The terms of GNU Library GPL allow binary redistribution with attendant source code,
but since all we downloaded the JAR directly from the author's website (above), 
we don't have the source code ourselves.
