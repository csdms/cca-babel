Every patch to a named release should include a two line file in this
directory. The filename should be 14 characters or less and end with
".txt".  The filename before ".txt" should be a brief name for the patch.

The first line of the file should be a terse description of what the
patch solves in language that's understandable by Babel end users. The
second line should be an email address associated with the person
issuing the patch.  Ideally, the first line should be 46 characters or
less, and the email address on line two should be 21 characters or
less. These character limits are not strictly enforced, but it makes
the columns line up correctly for babel-config --version-full.
