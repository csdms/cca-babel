This is a severely pruned version of CHASM, a Fortran language
interoperability tool developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
This version *only* has the particular features required by Babel, and
everything else has been removed.  In particular, Babel uses CHASM to
initialize and nullify Fortran array descriptors for a wide variety of
compiler vendors.  The Babel team is very grateful for CHASM, and we
want to acknowledge Los Alamos' important contribution.

For the complete version of CHASM, please see

The key contributors to CHASM include:
	Craig Rasmussen
	Matt Sottile
	Chris Rickett
