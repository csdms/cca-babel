/**
 * sidl helper macro that checks the status of an exception.  If the exception
 * is not set, then this macro does nothing.  If the exception is set, then
 * a stack trace line is added to the exception and control jumps to the user
 * defined EXIT block for exception processing.
 *
 * Suggested usage: This macro should be placed at the end of the line of
 * each function call.  By doing so, the line entered into the stack trace
 * is more accurate and the code more readable.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 * void myfunction(..., sidl_BaseInterface *_ex)
 * {
 *   ...
 *   foo(..., _ex); EXEC_CHECK(*_ex);
 *   ...
 *   EXEC_ERR:;
 *     / * clean up and return with exception set in _ex * /
 * }
 *
 * WARNINGS:  
 * Do not use this within an EXEC_ERR block!
