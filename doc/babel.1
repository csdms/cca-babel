.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Babel is a high\-performance language interoperability tool. The
project is mainly developed at the Center for Applied Scientific
Computing (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
(LLNL). Babel started as an internal Lab Directed Research and
Development (LDRD) project in 2000 and has been under constant
development since then. It is now funded mainly under the
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science\(aqs SciDAC program.
.sp
Babel currently fully supports C, C++, Fortran 77/90/2003/2008, Python,
and Java. It won a prestigious R&D 100 award in 2006 for "The world\(aqs
most rapid communication among many programming languages in a single
application.".
.sp
Our tool is based on the Scientific Interface Description Language
(SIDL). SIDL is tailored to the needs of the scientific community and
features support for complex numbers, structs, and dynamic
multidimensional arrays. Babel is a compiler that generates glue code
from SIDL interface descriptions. SIDL provides a modern object
oriented programming model, even on top of traditional procedural
languages. This includes automatic reference counting and resource
(de)allocation. Code written in one language can be called from any of
the supported languages.
.sp
Babel focuses on high\-performance language interoperability within a
single address space. Full support for Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
allows for the development of parallel distributed applications.
.sp
We also provide tools to automatically generate documentation from
SIDL descriptions. An equivalent XML representation eases development
of third\-party tools.
.sp
The full manual (amounting to several hundred printed pages) can be found at
<\fI\%https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/components/docs/users_guide/index.html\fP>.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\-\-include\-referenced
.INDENT 0.0
