This appendix focuses on providing tips, tricks, and advice submitted by 
Babel/SIDL users. We have generally provided the information verbatim.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc98"></A><A NAME="htoc117">23.2</A>  Compilation Consistency is Key</H2><P><EM><B>Steve Smith, 24 September 2001</B></EM></P><P>Basically “be consistent” is the biggest lesson we found. </P><P>When compiling C++ codes, you may have conflicts if you use different
compile options. Under KCC we found -no_exceptions caused problems if
parts were compiled with/without the flag. 
There are most likely other compile flags which turn features on/off 
which would cause similar problems. 
This caused a core dump immediately when core file was
loaded. This is somewhat obvious but if you are linking together several
different codes from a variety of developers you need to examine the
compile flags very carefully. This problem is probably more likely with
C++ due to the greater number of code generation options (e. g. RTTI,
exceptions etc).</P><P>A much more subtle problem occurred when we had a C shared library which
called functions in a C++ shared library. We initially used gcc to create
the C shared library and KCC to create the C++ shared library. The
application would core dump when a dynamic cast was attempted. This was
solved by using the <TT>cc</TT> compiler wrapper that is part of the KCC
distribution (which uses the native <TT>cc</TT>). So you need to be aware of not
only what is in your .so and how it is compiled but all the .so’s that you
are using.</P><P>If you have several versions of a library, say during a debugging process,
make sure you are using the correct versions of things. The <TT>ldd</TT> command
is very useful for making sure you getting the shared libraries that you
think you should be linking to. Along these lines, keep your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH as simple as possible when debugging.</P><P>In retrospect this does not look like a large number of problems, but
figuring out the second problem took a long time since I focused on how the
C++ library was being created rather than where the real problem was being
introduced. It wasn’t until after I had exhausted a long list of other
potential conflicts that I started messing with the C library compilation.
