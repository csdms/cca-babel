</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc30"></A><A NAME="htoc31">7.1</A>  Upgrading from Babel 1.0 to 1.4</H2><P>This section covers some of the important changes for users upgrading
from Babel 1.0 to Babel 1.4. Users who are new to Babel 1.4 should
skip this chapter because it gets into details that only experienced
Babel users will understand.</P><P>There are two major changes for users upgrading. The first involves
renaming certain splicer blocks in the C and C++ bindings, and the
second involves the extra comments needed for the CCA’s Bocca
IDE. Both these changes require new command line options.</P><P>Some splicer blocks have been renamed from what they were in Babel
1.0. The <TT>_misc</TT> and <TT>_includes</TT> in a C or C++ implementation
header file have been renamed to <TT>_hmisc</TT> and
<TT>_hincludes</TT>. The goal of this change has to give each splicer
block a unique name across the implementation header and
implementation source files. In Babel 1.0, the header and source both
have a splicer blocks named <TT>_misc</TT> and <TT>_includes</TT>. This
made things confusing for Bocca users.</P><P>To help users upgrading from Babel 1.0 to 1.4, Babel 1.4 has a
<TT>--rename-splicers</TT> command line option that will
automatically rename the header splicer blocks whose names have
changed. Once you’ve generated new implementation header files, you
do not need to keep using <TT>--rename-splicers</TT>.</P><P>To support CCA’s Bocca, Babel 1.0 introduced extra comments to guide
the Bocca IDE to blocks of text that need to be edited. In Babel 1.4,
you need to specifically request these extra comments with
<TT>--cca-mode</TT>.
