<P><A NAME="c:build"></A></P><P><EM>Babel generates very portable source code for multilingual programing.
There is also an art and science to transforming the source code to 
binary assets without breaking the language encapsulation Babel is
trying to create. This chapter discusses the details: from the mundane
issues of file layout, to the arcana of linker and loader flags.

<A NAME="@default1891"></A>
Babel generates a lot of files. Many of these files you never have to 
look at in an editor, but they must all be compiled and properly linked
into an application (see Section <A HREF="#s:libgrouping">19.2</A>). 
In this section we discuss several flags that can affect where
files are generated.
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>output-directory<CODE>=</CODE></TT></B><FONT COLOR=maroon><I>path</I></FONT><BR>
This sets the root directory of where your files will be generated.
The path can be absolute, or relative to the current working directory.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>generate-subdirs</TT></B><BR>
This option forces files to be laid out in a directory hierarchy 
following the package hierarchy in the SIDL file. This arrangement
is required for the Java and Python languages, so those generators
force this option on and allow no means to turn it off.
For C, C++, <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">fortran 77</SPAN>, and Fortran 90/95, the default is that all files are
generated in the single output directory with no package-named
subdirectories.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>language-subdir</TT></B><BR>
This option was contributed by a user. This option appends a 
language-specific subdirectory (e. g. c, python, f77) to the end
of the path.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>hide-glue</TT></B><BR>
This option was contributed by a user. The intent here is to separate
the Impl files (which must be modified) from all other files.
If this flag is set, then wherever an Impl file gets generated, 
all the corresponding Skels, Stubs, IORs, etc get generated in
a subdirectory named <CODE>glue</CODE>.
</LI></UL><P>Arbitrary combinations of the above flags are allowed. Regardless
of the order they appear in the commandline, they are applied to the
resulting path in the order they are presented above. For example
if a SIDL file <TT>pkg.sidl</TT> defines a <FONT COLOR=maroon><I><TT>Cls</TT></I></FONT> class in the <FONT COLOR=maroon><I><TT>pkg</TT></I></FONT> package, 
and the user runs Babel as follows:
</P><BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="quotation"><TT>
% <B>babel -lugo there -sc</B><BR>
</TT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Then the majority of the sources will be generated in the <TT>there/pkg/c/glue/</TT> directory
(except the Impl files which will occur one directory up in <TT>there/pkg/c/</TT>).
Note the use of equivalent short-form commands in this example.
If readers wish to review long and short forms of command line arguments, 
see Table <A HREF="index006.html#tbl:basics_commandline_args">4.1</A> on page <A HREF="index006.html#tbl:basics_commandline_args">??</A>. </P><P>Note that many of these options were contributed by users and are not
employed in Babel’s own build. Instead, we tend to put a SIDL file in
a directory and then generate client-side or server-side bindings in 
either <TT>runXXX/</TT> or <TT>libXXX/</TT> subdirectories, respectively (where <TT>XXX</TT> 
is a language name).
We don’t use the <B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>generate-subdirs</TT></B> or <B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>hide-glue</TT></B>
flags because they place source files that belong in the same library in different
directories. Automake, which Babel uses as part of its build system, works much more
reliably when all the sources that go into a library appear in the same directory
as the library to be. The <B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>language-subdir</TT></B> has a similar effect
to what we do manually, but doesn’t capture if it was client-side or server-side.
In our tests and demos, we tend to build these separately because we want to exercise
different drivers with different implementations.</P><P>The GNUmakefile generated by the <CODE>--</CODE><TT>makefile</TT> command line
option does not attempt to address all the possible combination of
flags affecting the layout of generated files. It assumes that you
generate files in the default locations.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc75"></A><A NAME="htoc90">19.2</A>  Grouping compiled assets into Libraries</H2><P><A NAME="s:libgrouping"></A></P><P>Babel enables one to completely encapsulate language dependencies inside
a static or dynamically loaded library. This means that one can take
a SIDL file and a compiled library, generate the bindings they want in 
their language of choice from the SIDL file, link against the library, 
and use it never knowing what the original implementation language was.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">19.2.1  Basics of Compilation and Linkage</H3><P><A NAME="ss:compilebootcamp"></A></P><P>What we generally think of as a compiler is really an ensemble of related
tools. Generally there is a preprocessing step where very simple transformations
occur (e. g. #define, #include directives and others). Next, the compiler
proper executes and typically transforms your sourcecode into assembler or
some other intermediate form. Optimizers work on this intermediate form and
do perform additional transformations. Most big vendors of C, C++, and Fortran
compilers have a common optimizer for all languages. Next, assemblers transform
the optimized codes into platform-specific binaries. But this is not the end.
The binaries may be linked together into libraries or programs. Libraries can 
be linked against other libraries, and eventually multiple programs. 
The main difference is that a program has additional instructions to bootstrap 
itself, do some interaction with the operating system, receive an argument list, 
and call <TT>main()</TT>. To see all this in action, try building a “hello world”
type program in your favorite language, and run the “compiler” with an additional
flag such as <B><TT>-v</TT></B>, <B><TT><CODE>--</CODE>verbose</TT></B>, or whatever.</P><P>For example, this is what I get from a g77 compiler.

</TT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For the purposes of this discussion, we will make a distinction between 
linking to build a library and linking to build an executable. Even though
these processes have similar names, they perform very different kinds
of code transformations.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">19.2.2  Circular Dependencies and Single-Pass Linkers</H3><P>
<A NAME="@default1892"></A><A NAME="@default1893"></A>
<A NAME="@default1894"></A></P><P>Almost all linkers are single pass. This means that when linking an executable, 
linkers will run through the list of libraries exactly once trying to resolve symbols
Ever get libraries listed in the wrong order and an executable wouldn’t get built?
Ever have to list the same libraries over and over again to build an executable?
These are both side-effects of single pass linkers. The symbols in question
are essentially jumps in the instruction code corresponding to subroutines that
are defined elsewhere. When linking a final executable, all these symbols
need to be resolved. When linking libraries, multiple undefined symbols
are commonplace.</P><P>Having to list libraries over and over again in the link line when compiling
the final executable typically indicates a circular dependency between libraries.
Circular dependencies are much better kept within a single library.
Even though linkers are single-pass between libraries, they exhaustively search within them.</P><P>This is important because all the files generated by Babel have a circular dependency 
in each Babel type. The stub makes calls on the IOR, the IOR calls the Skel, the Skel 
calls the Impl, but the Impl also may make calls on a Stub. Just like C++ has a <TT>this</TT>
object, and Python has a <TT>self</TT>, Babel objects have a stub for them to 
call methods on themselves and dispatch properly through Babel’s IOR layer.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">19.2.3  IOR as single point of access</H3><P><A NAME="ss:IORsinglepointaccess"></A></P><P>When building a Babelized library, it’s important to note if your code has 
dependencies to other Babel types not in your library. These types often appear as
base classes, argument types, or even exception types. Your library will need
stubs corresponding to all these types, so it is best to put these in your library
as well. We call these external stubs. </P><P>Many have tried to minimize replication of Babel stubs by removing the external stubs
and letting the library link directly against the stubs in an external library. 
This is a mistake because the external library may be implemented in a different
language, and the stubs may be for a different language binding. By bundling 
the external stubs specific to your implementation with the implementation’s library, 
you are ensuring that the only access your library has with any other Babelized library
is through the IOR. This is a good thing. The Babel IOR is the same for all language
bindings and essentially forms the binary interface by which all Babel objects interact.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc76"></A><A NAME="htoc91">19.3</A>  Dynamic vs. Static Linking</H2><P><A NAME="s:linking"></A>
<A NAME="@default1895"></A><A NAME="@default1896"></A></P><P>Most UNIX users are very comfortable with statically linked libraries
(e. g. <TT>libXXX.a</TT>). Most are aware of “shared object files” in 
UNIX (with the form <TT>libXXX.so</TT>) though few actually build them. 
Even fewer still are familiar with dynamically linked libraries, 
called DLL’s in Microsoft (after the common <TT>.dll</TT> suffix), which involve
actually selecting and loading dynamic libraries at run time based on their 
string name. MacOSX uses the novel suffix <TT>libXXX.dynlib</TT>.
(In most UNIX systems, including Linux and Solaris, .so “shared object files” are actually
dynamically linked libraries.) This section serves as a quick overview of how Babel handles 
both static and dynamic libraries, including runtime loading.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">19.3.1  Linkers and Position Independent Code (PIC)</H3><P><A NAME="ss:pic"></A>
<A NAME="@default1897"></A>
In a static library, the linker simply copies needed compilation units 
from the library to the executable. The static library can subsequently
be deleted with no adverse affects to the executable. This also causes
common libraries to be duplicated in every executable that links against
it, and for the resulting executables to be quite large.</P><P>In a shared library, the linker simply inserts in the executable enough
information to find the library and load it when the executable is invoked.
This typically happens before the program ever gets to <TT>main()</TT>.
This keeps executables small and allows commonly used libraries to be
reused without copying, but it also means that the executable can fail
if the library is renamed, moved, deleted, or even if the user’s
environment changes sufficiently. </P><P>A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for shared libraries to
work is that all the compilation units (<TT>*.o</TT>) contained must be
explicitly compiled as <EM>position independent code</EM> (PIC).
Position independent code has an added level of indirection in
critical areas since details (such as addresses to jump to in
subroutine calls) are not known until runtime. Even though shared
libraries are very useful, PIC causes a small but measurable
degradation in performance, making static linked libraries with
non-PIC code a viable option for performance-critical situations.</P><P>A dynamic-linked library is a shared library with one added feature, 
it can be loaded explicitly by the user at runtime by passing the string
name into <TT>dlopen()</TT>. Dynamic-linked libraries (DLL’s) also require
compilation as PIC, though many compilers (including GCC) have special 
commands for each<SUP><A NAME="text27" HREF="#note27">1</A></SUP>.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">19.3.2  Tracking Down Problems</H3><P>

SIDL runtime library. The library provides a base interface, class,
and exception as the foundation. This is how Babel provides object-oriented
features to non-object-oriented languages. In order to support the runtime
system and build the SIDL library, it also provides DLL and Loader classes.</P><P><A NAME="@default1900"></A>Babel generated code depends critically on <TT>babel_config.h</TT> to correctly
define a lot of platform specific details. One detail that changes too 
frequently to encode in <TT>babel_config.h</TT> is whether or not the software 
is being compiled is position independent code (PIC). This detail is commonly 
added to the compilation instruction using the flags (e. g. <TT>-fPIC -DPIC</TT>
<SUP><A NAME="text28" HREF="#note28">2</A></SUP>). The first flag tells the compiler to generate position independent 
code. The second defines the preprocessor macro <TT>PIC</TT>. Looking now at 
<TT>babel_config.h</TT>, we see that either <TT>SIDL_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY</TT> or 
<TT>SIDL_STATIC_LIBRARY</TT> are defined depending on whether or not <TT>PIC</TT> 
is defined.</P><P>As described in Section <A HREF="#ss:pic">19.3.1</A>, Babel tends to focus on static libraries 
and dynamic linked libraries; not worrying much about <A NAME="@default1901"></A>shared libraries. The 
main reason is that for every last drop of performance, people would want 
static libraries. To support Java and Python (and the CCA model) dynamic 
loading is required. There’s no real benefit to doing shared libraries that 
can’t be dynamically loaded, so in developing Babel, we focus on the other two 
linkage situations.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc78"></A><A NAME="htoc93">19.5</A>  Language Bindings for the <TT>sidl</TT> Package</H2><P>The implementation and C stubs for the <TT>sidl</TT> package are stored

<TT>babel-config --libdir</TT>. Normally, running <TT>babel-config

chosen a different directory by specifying a <TT>--prefix</TT> when they
configured Babel (see Section <A HREF="index005.html#s:configure">3.1.1</A>). The IOR header files
