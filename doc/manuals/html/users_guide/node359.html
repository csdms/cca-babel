Compilation Consistency is Key</A>

Basically ``be consistent'' is the biggest lesson we found.  

<P>
When compiling C++ codes, you may have conflicts if you use different
compile options.  Under KCC we found -no_exceptions caused problems if
parts were compiled with/without the flag.  
There are most likely other compile flags which turn features on/off 
which would cause similar problems.  
This caused a core dump immediately when core file was
loaded.  This is somewhat obvious but if you are linking together several
different codes from a variety of developers you need to examine the
compile flags very carefully.  This problem is probably more likely with
C++ due to the greater number of code generation options (e.g. RTTI,
exceptions etc).

<P>
A much more subtle problem occurred when we had a C shared library which
called functions in a C++  shared library.  We initially used gcc to create
the C shared library and KCC to create the C++ shared library.  The
application would core dump when a dynamic cast was attempted.  This was
solved by using the <TT>cc</TT> compiler wrapper that is part of the KCC
distribution (which uses the native <TT>cc</TT>).  So you need to be aware of not
only what is in your .so and how it is compiled but all the .so's that you
are using.

<P>
If you have several versions of a library, say during a debugging process,
make sure you are using the correct versions of things.  The <TT>ldd</TT> command
is very useful for making sure you getting the shared libraries that you
think you should be linking to.  Along these lines, keep your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH as simple as possible when debugging.

<P>
In retrospect this does not look like a large number of problems, but
figuring out the second problem took a long time since I focused on how the
C++ library was being created rather than where the real problem was being
introduced.  It wasn't until after I had exhausted a long list of other
potential conflicts that I started messing with the C library compilation.
