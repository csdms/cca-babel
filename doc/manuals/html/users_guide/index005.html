<EM>Ideally, Babel will configure and make “out-of-the-box” on most 
Unix-like machines. If the configuration process detects that 
certain resources are unavailable, it will correctly disable support
for languages or features needing those resources. If this instance
of correct behavior is not the intended behavior, then the installer 
is left to install the external resources and then re-configure, make, 
and install Babel. This chapter is intended to provide help and
reassurance that Babel is indeed configured and installed correctly.

(e. g. *.tar.gz file). We have volunteers 
who put together and manage RedHat RPMs<A NAME="@default39"></A> and
Debian *.deb<A NAME="@default40"></A> distributions of Babel. If you have one of
these distros, read their documentation first as it
may have details that supersede our own.</P><P>A typical build is a simple sequence of

The <B><TT>-C</TT></B> tells configure to cache its results in a
file. This improves the overall speed of configuration because the
runtime configure script reuses the results of the top-level configure.</P><P>There are many circumstances where the configuration step will
properly terminate with an error, but if the configuration works, the
build and installation shouldn’t terminate abnormally. If you have
problems or note bugs during configuration, installation or later

Bourne shell script that the configure creates in the <TT>bin</TT>

follows:

</TT></BLOCKQUOTE><H3 CLASS="subsection">3.1.1  Configure</H3><P><A NAME="s:configure"></A><A NAME="@default41"></A></P><P>There are two main choices to be made at configure time:
“Where does the software get built?” and 
“Where does the software get installed?”. The mechanisms
for effecting these choices are quite different.</P><P>If you want to build software in a separate directory from
where the tarball was untarred, this is called a “VPATH build”.
VPATH<A NAME="@default42"></A> builds are useful if you want to build Babel multiple times 
with various compilers, flags, or you have a shared filesystem 
across multiple platforms. It separates the code you generate
from things that you were given. The downside is that it is more
complex to remember where to edit what since original sources will
be in the source directory tree and the generated sources and 
compiled assets will be in the build directory tree.</P><P>If you run configure in the directory it appears, (i. e. you typed
<B><TT>./configure</TT></B>) you are performing an “non-VPATH build”.
To do a VPATH build, simply cd to the directory you want to be
the build directory root, then launch configure from there.
The following sequence demonstrates a vpath build

 % <B>../babel-x.x.x/configure -C</B><BR>
</TT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Note that the directory where you build Babel should be
different from the directory where you install Babel.
The default install directory is <TT>/usr/local</TT>, but can
be set to any directory that you have read/write access to.
To change the install directory<A NAME="@default43"></A>, run configure with the 
<B><TT>--prefix</TT></B><A NAME="@default44"></A> option. Since many people do not
have root access on their machine (or prefer to install in
a local directory when dealing with unfamiliar software), 
this option is probably the second most heavily used
option for configure (first being <B><TT>--help</TT></B>, which
is a good one to try also.)</P><P>At the time of this writing (1.1.0), there are two configure
scripts in Babel, about 47K lines of shell script each.
These configure scripts will then propagate the information they
acquire to Makefiles by performing approximately 190 sed substitutions 
(per Makefile), to the source code by setting approximately
170 preprocessor macros in babel_config.h, and various bits of
shell script in the build that do not get propagated to the install
directory. The configure script does not modify any source code in 
Babel’s runtime system or code generator. This means that source
code generated by a different Babel installation is usable as long
as it gets compiled against the local babel_config.h and linked
with the local Babel runtime libraries.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">3.1.2  Make</H3><P><A NAME="@default45"></A></P><P>The makefiles are generated by the configure script from Makefile.in<A NAME="@default46"></A> 
templates. The configure script is generated by a tool called 
autoconf<A NAME="@default47"></A>. The Makefile.in’s are generated from Makefile.am<A NAME="@default48"></A> files
by a separate, related tool called automake<A NAME="@default49"></A>. We also use a tool
called libtool<A NAME="@default50"></A> to help with libraries. Libtool is written in shell, 
automake in perl<A NAME="@default51"></A>, and autoconf in m4<A NAME="@default52"></A>.</P><P>After a successful configuration step, if your build fails it is
most likely that there is a bug in Babel, autoconf, libtool, or 
a library of m4 macros from any of the above. It is less likely 
to be an issue with automake, but possible. Perl and m4 themselves
are no longer involved in the process after the configure script
is produced, so while there may be a nascent bug in the files they
generated, it is unlikely.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">3.1.3  Make Check (Optional)</H3><P><A NAME="@default53"></A><A NAME="@default54"></A>
This is an exhaustive check that can take hours to complete on an
average workstation. The number of actual tests run depends on the
number of languages that are enabled. In general a driver and an
implementation of each test is generated in each enabled language.
Then each combination of driver and implementation are run (both
statically linked libraries and dynamically loaded libraries, as
appropriate) and tested. A test script can actually launch multiple
tests, and tests can have multiple parts. At the time of this writing
(babel-0.9.3) there are over 13,000 parts tested when all languages
are enabled.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">3.1.4  Make Install</H3><P><A NAME="@default55"></A><A NAME="@default56"></A></P><P>This transfers built software to the final installation directory.
Examples and tests are not installed, nor are Makefiles or
dozens of other types of files. Make install also builds javadoc
documentation for Babel’s code generator. Since some libraries are
built with install paths in mind, libtool uses a lot of scripts
to make things work in their build directory with binaries actually
hidden in .lib subdirectories. Make install strips this extra scaffolding
away as well.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection">3.1.5  Make Installcheck (Optional)</H3><P><A NAME="@default57"></A></P><P>This is the same test suite as with make check. The only
difference is that it is run against the code in the 
install directories, not the build directories.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc15"></A><A NAME="htoc12">3.2</A>  External Software

Babel objects implemented in python. In this case, the Babel runtime 
needs to dynamically load the python virtual machine (libpython.so).
Unfortunately, python does not always build a dynamically loadable version
of this library by default. If the Babel configure script cannot find
a libpython.so, it will disable server-side Python support.</P><P>At the time of this writing, Python cannot be coerced to build a
