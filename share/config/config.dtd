   Description: DTD for the machine configuration database

   This file describes the DTD for the Babel machine configuration database.

   The XML metadata description file metadata.xml defines the languages
   supported by the Babel compiler and the allowable options and parameters
   for the configurations supported by each language.  In this XML document,
   we define configurations that associate particular values with each
   allowable option.  These configurations are given the name profile.
   Each configuration may be named by multiple profile elements that
   describe the environments for which those choices are valid.

   The root element is <Configuration>.
-->

<!--
   Configuration Element

   Configuration is the root element for all machine configuration XML
   schema.  A configuration contains any number of Language elements that
   represent the programming languages supported by the Babel compiler.
-->

<!ELEMENT Configuration (Language)*>

<!--
   Language Element

   Language elements may be empty or consist of a number of profiles along
   with an options block.  An empty element indicates that there are no
   machine configuration options for that language.  If not empty, then
   one or more Profile elements are used to provide a name for the set
   of configuration options defined by Options.  The language name attribute
   must match the language name in the metadata.xml XML description.
-->

<!ELEMENT Language ((Profile)+, Options)?>
<!ATTLIST Language name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
   Profile Element

   The Profile element defines a profile name that will be used to select
   the configuration options.  A profile must contain a description and
   may contain additional architecture and compiler information.
-->

<!ELEMENT Profile (Description, (Architecture)?, (Compiler)?)>
<!ATTLIST Profile name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
   Description Element

   A Description element describes a profile.  It requires a summary
   attribute and may contain a longer HTML-lite comment.
-->

<!ENTITY % html-lite SYSTEM "html-lite.dtd">
%html-lite;

<!ELEMENT Description %html-block;>
<!ATTLIST Description summary CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
   Architecture Element

   The Architecture element describes the machine architecture.  It contains
   three attributes:

      cpu     required description of the machine hardware (sparc or i686)
      os      required description of the operating system (SunOS or Linux)
      release optional release of the operating system (5.7 or 2.0.34)

   If the release is not provided, then the value "default" is used.
-->

<!ELEMENT Architecture EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST Architecture cpu     CDATA #REQUIRED
                       os      CDATA #REQUIRED
                       release CDATA "default">

<!--
   Compiler Element

   The Compiler element describes the compiler for which the profile is
   defined.  The compiler attributes include the compiler name and the
   compiler version (which defaults to "default" if none is provided).
-->

<!ELEMENT Compiler EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST Compiler name    CDATA #REQUIRED
                   version CDATA "default">

<!--
   Options and Selection Elements

   An Options element groups a collection of Selection elements.  Each
   Selection element contains a required option attribute and a required
   value attribute.  Both the option and value must be valid selections
   for this language, as defined by the metadata XML description.
-->

<!ELEMENT Options (Selection)+>

<!ELEMENT Selection EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST Selection option CDATA #REQUIRED
                    value  CDATA #REQUIRED>
