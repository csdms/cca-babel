 * This class will write a file leaving its last time modified unchanged if
 * the content is unchanged. When overwriting a file, this {@link
 * java.io.Writer} will initially write a temporary file. When {@link
 * #close} is called, it compares the contents of the original file with the
 * temporary file. If the contents have changed, it will overwrite the
 * original file with the contents of the temporary file; otherwise, the
 * original file is left unchanged. Thus, the last time modified of the
 * original file is only changed when the contents change. The temporary
 * file is deleted when {@link #close} is called.
